# What's this then?

It's a bunch of lab exercises set as part of a software development course to help practice some of the basics of Python. In particular, it's focused around traversal of lists (a.k.a. arrays in non-Python languages) and dictionaries (a.k.a. hash tables/maps).


# What does it actually do, though?

None of this is really intended to be a proper program, as such, it's just a series of Python files with really simple code in them. The point was more to be able to build code-writing literacy than it was to make a useful program.

Exercise A messes with a list of stops along a rail journey.

Exercise B introduces dictionaries: it's a dictionary containing three key:value pairs representing people, which in turn contain both lists and sub-dictionaries, to add some complexity to traversal.

Exercise C is a list with dictionaries inside it, storing population figures and capital cities for three of the constituent countries within the United Kingdom.

Exercise D is where it starts to get a wee bit spicier. The actual data set is much simpler, being a plain old list of integers. The logical manipulations aren't necessarily as straightforward as the kind of stuff the previous exercises called for, though.

Exercise E is a list of lists, as in a list containing other lists. (It's presumably called "nested arrays" because what Python calls "lists" are more commonly referred to as "arrays".)
